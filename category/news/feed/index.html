										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Magnetostrictive sensors are a revolutionary technology that has transformed the way we measure positions and levels in various industries. If you&#8217;re looking for a reliable and accurate way to measure distances, TEC Sensors&#8217; magnetostrictive sensors are the solution you need.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>How Magnetostrictive Sensors Work</strong></p>
<p>Magnetostrictive sensors use the magnetostriction phenomenon, where a magnetic field causes a change in the length of a ferromagnetic material. In magnetostrictive sensors, a magnetostrictive wire is used as a sensing element. When a current pulse is applied to the wire, it generates a magnetic field that interacts with a magnetic float or a ring placed around the wire. This interaction creates a torsional wave that travels along the wire at a known speed. By measuring the time it takes for the wave to reach the float or the ring, the sensor can calculate the distance between the sensing element and the float or ring with high accuracy.</p>
<p>Applications of Magnetostrictive Sensors</p>
<p>Magnetostrictive sensors are widely used in various industries to measure position and level, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tank level measurement for oil and gas, wastewater treatment, and chemical processing</li>
<li>Position measurement in industrial automation, robotics, and aerospace</li>
<li>Distance measurement in agricultural and construction equipment</li>
</ul>
