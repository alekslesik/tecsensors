In magnetostrictive sensors, a magnetostrictive wire is used as a sensing element. When a current pulse is applied to the wire, it generates a magnetic field that interacts with a magnetic float or a ring placed around the wire. This interaction creates a torsional wave that travels along the wire at a known speed. By measuring the time it takes for the wave to reach the float or the ring, the sensor can calculate the distance between the sensing element and the float or ring with high accuracy.<\/p>\n<p>Applications of Magnetostrictive Sensors<\/p>\n<p>Magnetostrictive sensors are widely used in various industries to measure position and level, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tank level measurement for oil and gas, wastewater treatment, and chemical processing<\/li>\n<li>Position measurement in industrial automation, robotics, and aerospace<\/li>\n<li>Distance measurement in agricultural and construction equipment<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Why Choose TEC Sensors&#8217; Magnetostrictive Sensors<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>TEC Sensors is a leading manufacturer of high-quality magnetostrictive sensors that provide accurate and reliable position and level measurements.
